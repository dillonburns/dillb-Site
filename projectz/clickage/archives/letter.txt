The News Rocked the Nation!  ASTROLOGY IN THE WHITE HOUSE!  PEOPLE
         magazine ran it as its cover story in the May 23, 1988 issue.
         Nancy Reagan was manipulating the President's schedule based upon
         astrological charts drawn up by a San Francisco soothsayer named
         Joan Quigley.  It wasn't the first time the resident of the White
         House was doing a balancing act with the stargazers.  Teddy
         Roosevelt kept his own a
         such a design is a SPRITUAL DOOR to the occult, a planned invasion
         by the powers of darkness against this Christian nation.  "We have
         been under siege from the first day our first President walked
         into the Oval Office," Bill stated.

         Bill added that Albert Pike, the giant of Masonic philosophy who
         is entombed just 13 blocks from the White House in the "House of
         the Temple" has identified the pentagram (or "Pentapha") as the
         blazing star which is at the heart of every Masonic lodge and
         which represents the star Sirius.  (MORALS AND DOGMA, pp. 14-15)
         Now Sirius has been know for 5,000 years as the symbol of the
         Egyptian devil, SET; and it is regarded as a star of GREAT EVIL!
         (ALEISTER CROWLEY AND THE HIDDEN GOD by Kenneth Grant, p. 12).

         Bill emphasized that to the magician, the inverted pentagram has
         one use only, and that is to call up the power of Satan and bring
         the Kingdom of the Devil into manifestation on earth (MAN, MYTH
         AND MAGIC, p 2159).  Yet this very same symbol straddles the
         corridors of our nation's power and is "aimed" right at the White
         House!
